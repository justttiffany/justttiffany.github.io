              <h2>Overview</h2>
              <p>Never worry about where your significant other is anymore! CoupleTones is an Android App that allows couples to select their favorites locations around the world and notify each other when they are near or at that location.</p>

              <h2>Problem</h2>
              <p>Many couples have favorite locations anywhere around the world. These locations can serve as important memories for the couple, whether it was the location of their first date, proposal, or confession. With so many locations, it can be hard to keep track.</p>

              <h2>Solution</h2>
              <p>CoupleTones! CoupleTones helps couples log in all of their favorite locations, so they will never forget. CoupleTones will also notify the partner when their significant other is nearby or at their location, bringing back joyful memories and putting a smile on their face.</p>

              <p>The team's goal on this project was to learn and develop an Android app in an Agile environment, reducing the risk of technical error along the way. With only 10 weeks to complete the project, our team aimed to get the baseline functionality accomplished based on the client's input.</p>

            <p>Along with the team, I developed in Java, using Android Studio. Android's Documentation for Developers was used to help implement ringtones feature.

            <h2>Task</h2>
            <p>My task was to implement the vibration and ringtone notification feature of the app. The notification will only happen when the user is nearby or at the specified favorite location. The user can customize their notification to their preference.</p>

          <hr>
          <p>I had a great time working on this project. My team formed a close relationship near the middle of the project and we worked well together. However, it was a challenging project to say the least. It was challenging for several reasons. First, it was my first time working with Android Studio and developing an Android App. To address this, I did a lot of research on Android development documentation and developing in Android Studio. Second, the team comprised of individuals with different backgrounds of experience. It was difficult at times because sometimes several team members would not understand another's work because it was too advanced. We addressed this by assigning appropriate tasks to individuals that were capable and gave a learning curve. And thirdly, the short term of this project was challenging because timing of the deadlines were very strict and stressful. Client's responses change so the team had to development and plan accordingly. Overall, it was a great, but challenging experience. I got a flavor of what it's like working using the agile development process and the pace of the project.</p>
