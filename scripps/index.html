          <p class="lead text-muted text-center">Underwater Acoustics is a <b>Scripps project</b>, implemented under the guidance of Dr. Ana Sirovic, a researcher at the Marine Acoustics Lab of the Scripps Institute of Oceanography.  The project came about by researchers at the Scripps Institute of Oceanography when they decided to <b>deploy a detector</b> which recorded ocean sounds following the Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill of 2010.  The detector was left in the area for <b>7 years</b> and has since collected a significant amount of acoustic data, much of which is comprised of <b>fish calls</b>.</p>

              <h2>Overview</h2>
              <p>It is often unclear to what extent human activities have damaged ocean environments and whether or not our actions have been effective in repairing damaged habitats and restoring marine populations to their former states. Our project aims to address this issue by allowing researchers to monitor trends in sea life over long periods of time.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="col-md-3">
              <h2>Problem</h2>
              <p>Of the 7 years of acoustic data, researchers have been able to successfully anotate 2 years worth, classifying recurring acoustic patterns by the fish species that are believed to have produced them. This, however, is not an efficient process and even if researchers were to successfully parse all of the data, the question remains: What should be done with all of this information?</p>
            </div>
            <div class="col-md-3">
              <h2>Solution</h2>
              <p>Convolutional Neural Networks.  By taking the 2 years of annotated data and feeding it into a custom CNN as training data, the remaining data can be systematically organized and classified. Further, by developing a detector in parallel, the Neural Network can be used as a research tool for the long-term surveilance of sea-life populations.</p>

            <div class="col-md-3">
              <h2>Deliverables</h2>
              <p>Our project deliverables included three things: (1)<b> An Automated Detector</b> - takes in acoustic data and outputs the time of signal occurence., (2)<b> A User Friendly Interface</b> - an executable with means of interfacing between detector and classifier to allow researchers without a deep knowledge of MATLAB to use the tool, and (3)<b> The Classifier</b> - a CNN designed to classify fish species by the noises they produce.</p>

        <hr>
        <p>Overall, the project was a great way to get experience on working in a team and gaining technical skills.  I learned new skills, such as programming in MATLAB and developing a GUI using MATLAB'S GUIDE tool.  However, that happened to also be a challenge for me.  Prior to this project, I had no knowledge in programming in MATLAB.  Additionally, I did not know about Convolutional Neural Networks.  I overcame these obstacles by consulting my teammates for help when I needed to and doing lots of research while developing this project.  <br> <br> Also, throughout the project, we were well-monitored by the Scripps researcher by having bi-weekly check-ins to give updates on our progress and receiving feedback on how we were doing. At the end of the quarter, we turned in the final product and it was used to demo at a science conference the next month!</p>
