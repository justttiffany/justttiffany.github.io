I was on the Studio Enterprise Team, working on the development of Bluebeam's Studio Enterprise product. As an intern, I got to work on production code, participate in an agile development environment, and experience what it is like to work in the software industry. I gained new technical skills and got to work with awesome people! </p>

        <p class="text-muted text-center"> I worked in a team of 4 people under the supervision of a Scripps researcher to continue the development of a Convolutional Neural Network that can categorize and classify recorded fish noises according to species. My role in the team was a front-end software developer. My task, along with one other team member, was to implement a user-friendly interface using Matlab's GUIDE tool for the CNN to improve usability. In addition, I developed and maintained a team website with one other team member to document progress: <a href="https://www.underwateracoustics.netlify.com" style="text-decoration: none">underwateracoustics.netlify.com</a> </p>

         <p class="text-muted"> <i>Task</i>: Implement a user-friendly interface for the Convolutional Neural Network to improve usability. </p>

        <p class="text-muted"> <i>Technologies/Languages/Development Tools Used</i>: Matlab, Github </p>

        <p class="text-muted"> <i>Process</i>: We were given an existing code base to work with.  My role, along with one other team member, was to come up with a user-friendly interface for the program so users of any background can easily use and navigate with data. </p>

        <p class="text-muted">  Here was my process through working on this task (quarter-long project):
          <ul class="text-muted"> 
            <li>
              Began looking through the existing code legacy to understand what each file did
            </li>
            <li>
              Replicated the program to get an idea of how the program worked with the data passed in by users
            </li>
            <li>
              Researched how to create a GUI in MATLAB and began implementation of task
            </li>
            <li>
              Ported over the existing code base to the GUI program and modified the files to work towards a working interface
            </li>
            <li>
              Extensive testing to ensure the end product met the baseline functionality
            </li>
          </ul>
        </p>

        <p class="text-muted"> <i>Reflection</i>: Overall, the project was a great way to get experience on working in a team and gaining technical skills. I had never programmed in MATLAB, so that did give some challenges. We were well-monitored by the Scripps researcher by having bi-weekly check-ins to give an update on our progress.  At the end of the quarter, we turned in the final product and it was used to demo at a science conference the next month! The images shown above is the end working product. </p>

I worked in a team of 8 people on the Arduino Computer Development and Programming Project to development an Arduino micro-controller for the launching of a near-space balloon. We spent a total of 5 weeks developing the micro-controller. I worked on the temperature and pressure sensors with one other team member. </p>

          <p class="text-muted"> <i>Process</i>: We were given the hardware component (microcontroller) of the project and had to code up a program that collected data of its surrounding environment using the hardware. </p>

          <p class="text-muted">  Along with one other team member, here was the process working towards this task:
            <ul class="text-muted"> 
              <li>
                Researched information on temperature and pressure sensors and similar existing programs

              <li>
                Connected all the hardware components onto the microcontroller to begin testing of the program

              <li>
                Extensive testing of the program by doing test cases and changing surrounding environments
              </li>
              <li>
                Merged our program into the main team code base and tested to ensure integration was seamless
              </li>
            </ul>
          </p>

          <p class="text-muted"> <i>Reflection</i>: This was my first project as an intern and working on a team. I learned a new language and got a taste of working with hardware components, which is different to me because I mainly am comfortable with software. Some difficulties include the pace of the work because we did not receive the necessary equipment until halfway through the internship, so I had to catch up to speed in implementation because the deadline was approaching.  In the end, it was a successful project because it was used in the launching of a near-space balloon and teams reported back saying that the data was collected successfully. </p>

                Extensive testing to make sure the front-end and back-end logic was connected fully to result in a functional game

          <p class="text-muted"> <i>Reflection</i>: This was my first project in developing a full-stack game application.  I had no prior programming experience, so it was challenging at first.  A difficulty was learning to connect the front-end logic with the back-end logic to produce a functional application in the end.  Overall, I am proud at what I accomplished and I have a customized game of 2048! </p>
