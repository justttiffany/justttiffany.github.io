            <p class="sub-title pad-bt15">A truly rewarding and humbling experience.</p>
            <hr class="bottom-line">
            <p class="sub-title pad-bt15">My internship at Bluebeam was my <b>first internship</b>, so it was definitely a nerve-wrecking and challenging experience.  All I really knew about Computer Science was through classes I took in school.  But after 10 weeks spent at Bluebeam, I had <b>learned a lot and gained new technical skills</b>.  I learned new technologies used by development teams, such as C#, Visual Studio, and SSMS.  I got to experience what it's like to work in an Agile Development environment, a concept that I learned in school, by attending daily stand-ups and sprint meetings and utilizing JIRA.  The tasks that I worked on gave me a variety to work with and helped me develop my interpersonal skills by having me reach out to teammates for help and asking questions when I needed to.</p>
            <p class="sub-title pad-bt15">My internship was also a <b>challenging</b> one.  I had no prior internship or working experience before coming to Bluebeam.  I had no side projects to display.  I had no experience with the technologies Bluebeam used.  All I ever really knew about Computer Science was from the classroom.  So with the tasks I took on at Bluebeam, <b>every single one was something new</b>.  However, I made it goal to take on every task one-by-one and learn new things along the way.  By the end of the internship, I had accomplished several tasks that I never thought I could from day one.  My experience at Bluebeam has really given me the <b>confidence</b> in my technical abilities and I carried that confidence into my last year of college.  So that is what I meant by defining my summer as a <b>humbling experience</b>.  My internship was a challenging one, but mostly a humbling one. </p>
