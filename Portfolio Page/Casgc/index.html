              <p>The California Space Grant Consortium/UCSD Summer Academy was <b>sponsored by NASA</b> to provide undergraduate engineering students at UCSD a chance to gain technical experience.  I was placed on a team of <b>all females</b> because the goal was to promote more women in the STEM field and ensure that they stay within the engineering field.</p>

              <h3>Problem</h3>
              <p>Many teams in the science field can accomplish their goals and projects with the help of many <b>resources</b> in the world (i.e. Internet, science tool kits).  However, sometimes these resources are <b>not specific</b> to their needs or are <b>not readily available</b> at the moment.  This can slow done processes in development and delay workflow among teams. </p>

              <h3>Solution</h3>
              <p>Our team aimed on providing an <b>Arduino Computer Development and Programming Science Kit</b> for teams out there involved in Arduino development.  We worked towards developing an Arduino program that <b>collected data</b>, such as temperature, pressure, humidity, and acceleration.  This handy program was to provide an easy-to-use tool that users can just grab and use for their own projects.</p>

              <p>The team's <b>goal</b> on this summer project was to develop a fully functional Arduino micro-controller that successfully gathered data regarding its surroundings.  The end result was to be used for the <b>launching of a near-space balloon</b> by another team in the UCSD Summer Academy that summer.</p>

I learned a new programming language and got a taste of working with <b>hardware components</b>, which is different to me because I mainly am comfortable with software. However, this experience also came with <b>challenges</b>.  Our team did not receive our necessary equipment until the middle of our project, so we had to catch up more quickly once the equipment arrived because the deadline was approaching. Additionally, we had to account for other teammates' contribution as some were slower than others and communication was difficult because one of the team members was unresponsive at times.  I <b>overcame these obstacles</b> by helping out others when I completed my tasks and taking charge where things needed to be taken care of.  Despite these challenges, in the end, it was a <b>successful project</b> because it was used in the <b>launching of a near-space balloon</b> and teams reported back saying that the data was collected successfully.</p>
