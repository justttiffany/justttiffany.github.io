            <p class="sub-title pad-bt15">I had a great time working on this project.  My team formed a close relationship near the middle of the project and we worked well together.  However, it was a <b>challenging project</b> to say the least.  It was challenging for several reasons.  First, it was my first time working with Android Studio and developing an Android App.  To address this, I did a lot of research on Android development documentation and developing in Android Studio.  Second, the team comprised of individuals with different backgrounds of experience.  It was difficult at times because sometimes several team members would not understand another's work because it was too advanced.  We addressed this by assigning appropriate tasks to individuals that were capable and gave a learning curve.  And thirdly, the short term of this project was challenging because timing of the deadlines were very strict and stressful.  Client's responses change so the team had to development and plan accordingly.  Overall, it was a great, but challenging experience.  I got a flavor of what it's like working using the agile development process and the pace of the project.</p>
